Yet Anoter Torrent Player (YATP) is a torrent streaming video plugin for [Kodi](http://kodi.tv) mediacenter.
It allows to watch video torrents in Kodi while downloading them in the background.
The plugin can also be used a simple torrent-client.

**Main features:**

- Video torrents playback in Kodi.
- Seeding after playback.
- Speed, ratio and time limits for torrents.
- Support for multi-file torrents - you can select individual video files for playback.

Please read [project's Wiki](https://github.com/romanvm/kodi.yatp/wiki) if you want to find out more about YATP.

**Important notice**: YATP is a content-neutral solution. It is not tied to any specific site or content-type.
This is by design and will remain so. It is not my business where you get your torrents. If you want support
for a specific site or content, you can implement it yourself using YATP API, but that's entirely up to you.

The plugin is avaliable in [my Kodi addons repository](https://romanvm.github.io/kodi_repo/repo/repository.romanvm/repository.romanvm-2.0.0.zip).
